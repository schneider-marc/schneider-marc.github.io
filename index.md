# Projekt PEBSTER - Piled Embankments with a basal steel reinforcement
{: .fs-9 }

This page is currently still under construction.<br>
My name is [Marc Schneider](https://www.geotechnik.tu-darmstadt.de/institut_ivg/mitarbeitende_ivg/mitarbeiterliste_ivg_details_107072.de.jsp) and I created this page to give an easy overview of our research on Piled Embankments using a steel basal reinforcement. 
I am researching this topic as part of my doctorate at the Institute of Geotechnics at the Technical University of Darmstadt.

The research project PEBSTER (Piled Embankments with a Basal Steel Reinforcement) was conducted by an international research team combining the knowledge and experience of Keller Holding (Germany), Deltares (Netherlands), Nerve Sensors (Poland) and the Technical University of Darmstadt (Germany). 

I am grateful to be part of the research team consisting of:<br>
Marylin Hell, Paul Pandrea, Michał Topolnicki, Pascal Schauber - Keller Holding<br>
Suzanne J.M. van Eekelen, Britt Wittekoek - Deltares<br>
Karolina Makowska - Nerve Sensors<br>
Marc Schneider, Hauke Zachert - Technical University of Darmstadt<br>

The authors are grateful for the funding received from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under Grant Agreement No. 101006512 for the transnational [GEOLAB](https://project-geolab.eu/) project PEBSTER, the TKI-PPS funding of the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs and the financial support from Keller.
